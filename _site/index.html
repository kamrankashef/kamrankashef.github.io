            <h3>Data Infrastructure Design and Development</h3>
            <p>If data is the lifeblood of a business, then infrastructure is its heart. ETL pipelines, data lakes, vendor integrations, warehousing, performance tuning, modernization, and cloud migrations form the foundational layer of a data-driven business.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h3>Machine Learning and AI</h3>
            <p>Dark data refers to information assets that organizations collect, process, and store during regular business activities but fail to utilize for other purposes, such as analytics, business relationships, and direct monetization. In Splunk’s global research survey of over 1,300 business and IT decision-makers, 60 percent of respondents reported that more than half of their organization’s data is considered dark. Machine learning and AI tools, combined with domain knowledge, creativity, and common sense, have the power to turn dark data into actionable business insights. Using the rich set of tools in the Python ecosystem, I can help you leverage data to drive innovation.</p>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>Visualization &amp; Reporting</h3>
            <p>Distilling data analytics into reports and visualizations makes it easier to act on the insights. Tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Dash can provide dashboards for live, interactive data.</p>

        <h2>How We Can Work Together</h2>
        <div class="service">
            <h3>Start Small, Expand When It Feels Right</h3>
            <p>Time is precious, and it’s not always obvious who can help you. That’s why I always start projects on a small scale. Limited scope, low cost, and short-duration engagements are a great way to get to know each other. If you’re optimistic about what we can achieve together, we can expand the scope. In any case, the downside is capped, but the upside is not.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h3>Quick Start Capability</h3>
            <p>As a solo practitioner, I can be deployed with minimal lead time to address specific issues and provide targeted support. I can quickly ramp up a skunkworks project, design solutions, build models, or make engineering improvements to your data infrastructure.</p>
