			<h3>Data Infrastructure Design and Development</h3>
			<p>If data is the lifeblood of business, infrastructure is its heart. ETL pipelines, data lakes, vendor integrations, warehousing, performance tuning, modernization and cloud migrations are the foundational layer of a data driven business.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="service">
			<h3>Machine Learning and AI</h3>
			<p>Dark data are information assets organizations collect, process and store during regular business activities, but fail to use for other purposes, such as analytics, business relationships and direct monetizing. In Splunk’s global research survey of more than 1,300 business and IT decision makers, 60 percent of respondents reported that more than half of their organization’s data is considered dark.  Machine learning and AI tools combined with domain knowledge, creativity and common sense have the power to turn dark data into actionable business insights.  Using the rich set of tools in the Python ecosystem I can heep you use data to drive innovation.</p>

		<div class="service">
			<h3>Visualization &amp; Reporting</h3>
			<p>Distilling data analytics down to reports and visualizations will make it easier to action on.  Tools like Power BI, Tableau and Dash can provide dashboards for live interactive data.</p>

        <h2>How We Can Work Together</h2>
		<div class="service">
			<h3>Do a Little, If Everybody is Happy, Do More</h3>
			<p>Time is precious and it's not usually obvious who can help you. That's why I always start projects small.  Limited scope, low cost and short duration engagements
               are a great way to get to know each other.  If after that you're optimistic about what we can achieve together, we can do more.  In any case, the downside
               is capped, but the upside is not.</p>

			<h3>Zero-In on a Bottleneck In Need of Attention</h3>
            <p>
            As solo practitioner, I can be dropped into a hotspot on demand to give you leverage when and where you need it.
